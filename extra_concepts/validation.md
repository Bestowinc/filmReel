# Validation

## Partial Comparison:

Given a `validation` selector with a key of `{"partial": true}`, the
selected response object will non-recursively remove any elements in the actual
body that are not present in the Frame's response before attempting to compare
the actual and expected response.

```jsonc
{
  "protocol": "HTTP",
  "request": {
    "entrypoint": "http://localhost:8080",
    "uri": "GET /object"
  },
  "response": {
    "validation": { 
      // partial validation will be applied to the elements of the response body
      "response.body": {
        "partial": true
      }
    },
    "body": {
      "desired_response": "Success!"
    },
    "status": 200
  }
}
```


**Listing 1:** The Frame file above will remove any keys that are not
`"response"` from the response payload.

A partial comparison validator is meant to express: "I don't care about anything
extra except what I've specified in the Frame file".

Partial responses will only match for the exact value present found in the
selection with the exception of `{"objects": "and"}` `["arrays"]`:
* Objects will only be matched by the presence of keys and can will still fail
on a mismatch of values.
* Arrays will be searched for the _contiguous_ presence of the elements therein:
For a partial validation of array `[A,B,C]`, responses `[A,A,B,C]` and `[A,B,C]`
will result in a match but array `[A,A,B,B,C,C]` will not

## Unordered Comparison:

Given a `validation` selector with a key of `{"unordered": true}`, the
selected response object will attempt to order any elements in the actual
body as they are found in the Frame's response before attempting to compare
the actual and expected response.

```jsonc
{
  "protocol": "HTTP",
  "request": {
    "entrypoint": "http://localhost:8080",
    "uri": "GET /object"
  },
  "response": {
    "validation": { 
      // unordered validation will be applied to the elements of the response body
      "response.body": {
        "partial": true
      }
    },
    "body": {
      ["A", "B", "C"]
    },
    "status": 200
  }
}
```


**Listing 2:** The Frame file above will attempt, once per element given, to
place any string elements of values `"A"`, `"B"` or `"C"` to the front of the
actual response.

A partial comparison validator is meant to express: "I don't care about anything
extra except what I've specified in the Frame file".
